Great news! There is no need to register for conference talks! Conference presentations will be streamed on the days of the conference. Links and instructions for posting questions will be shared closer to the time of the conference on our websites and in our Twitter feeds.

*Where do I register to learn at the engaging workshops?*  
Registration will take place mid-May after we have finalized the list of workshops. The link and opening time for registration will be announced on Twitter and on our websites.

*How can I interact with other participants?*  
BSides is all about building a community! During the conference, folks will have a chance to gather and chat in a platform such as Slack or Discord. We will share the information about the platform and how to connect along with the conference day presentation links!

*Do you need any volunteers? How can I help?*  
If you are interested in helping organize the conference, please reach out to volunteers@bsidesmunich.org.  Aside from this, here are some other ideas that you can help!

 * On the days of the conference, join us, learn, ask questions and participate in the community!

# Speakers

*Where can I submit my presentation proposal?*  
You can submit proposal for presentations or workshops for BSidesMEsh at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bsidesmesh21!

*When do I need to be “at” the conference?*  
You should be present (virtually) at the conference during your presentation time. We would kindly ask that you stay connected to our conference chat platform during the conference so that you can answer any questions about your presentation from our participants.

*When should my presentation be ready?*  
Your presentation should be pre-recorded and shared with organizers by May 19, 2021.

# Workshop Leaders

*What conference platform will be used for workshops?*  
We will use a video conference platform for the workshop, and we are currently reviewing the options to fit our requirements. In general, you can expect to be able to speak, share slides, have a chat and have a way for participants to ask questions and give feedback. We will announce any links to materials or instructions that you share with us prior to the conference so that workshop participants can download materials.

*May I use other digital tools for the workshop (i.e., Miro, Google Docs, Kahoot)?*  
Feel free to make your workshop interactive in whichever way you want! But, please keep in mind that participants may not be excited about having to sign up for a service in order to be able to participate. Try to select interactive resources that participants can use without having to sign up.

*How many participants can I host at my workshop?*  
Since this is a virtual conference, the number of workshop participants is technically limited only by the virtual conference platform. That being said, there are practical limits to the number of participants that you need to consider. You may have limits due to hardware or licensing that you need to consider. Additionally, you need to also consider the structure of your workshop and the kinds of questions you will likely get from your audience. If you are alone hosting the session on your own, you might choose to have a smaller group of people (10-20). If you will have other folks supporting the session, you can expand the number of participants accordingly.

# Sponsors

*Should we sponsor BSidesMunich or Elbsides?*  
Advertising as a sponsor is a great way to reach local talent.
So, the natural suggestion is to target the BSides conference host that is closest to your target hiring office(s).
BSidesMunich is based in Munich, and Elbsides is based in Hamburg.  
That being said, last year’s virtual conference, BSMaaS (BSidesMunich as a Service) had only one day of presentations, and it reached over 600 participants.
We advertised mostly to our followers who tend to be located in Germany, but because it was a virtual conference, we were able to reach many more people both inside of Germany outside of our target cities and internationally.
So, if you are hoping to have the chance to reach an even broader international audience over the course of both conference days, sponsoring both conference hosts may be something for consideration.
