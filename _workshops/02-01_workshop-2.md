There is a constant battle between Cyber Defenders trying to protect their networks and the Threat Actors whose tactics and techniques keep evolving to circumvent our security solutions. 

Our best chance against these actors comes from understanding how they think and operate; analyzing information about these group's intent, capability, and motivations allows Cyber Defenders to be better prepared when an incident happens. 

In this workshop, we will learn ways to use OSINT in our favor during the Incident Response process.
