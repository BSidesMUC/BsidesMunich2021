There are so many facets to network security; sometimes, it’s more informative to look at some real-world examples of what keeps security at the forefront of today’s conversations.
In this talk, we’ll cover Physical Security -- the forgotten layer that nobody should forget, Network Security -- who and what should you be keeping out?
And, Identity Access -- are you sure you want those people logging into your network?
Using Graylog, we’ll step through how bad actors try to get through and how log management can stop them.
