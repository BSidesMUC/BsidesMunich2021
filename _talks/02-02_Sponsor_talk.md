Letâ€™s take an undercover dive into the world of No-Distribute Scanners: scanning portals often used by malware authors on their search for the perfect Fully UnDetectable (FuD) malware.
During the talk, we will go into detail about the different kinds of NDS portals, their userbase, how they are used, and how they work.
This will not only help you better understand how NDSs allow malware developers to increase the average time a sample goes unnoticed by the threat intelligence community, but to see how they use the results as tangible proof to monetize their offering.
