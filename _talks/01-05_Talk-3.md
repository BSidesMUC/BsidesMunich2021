    bio: | 
      I am a Security Researcher at Cisco Systems, India. I hold the SANS GIAC Reverse Engineering malware (GREM) certification and am also CEH certified. I hold the black belt in the Cisco Security Ninja program. 
      I have conducted cybersecurity and malware analysis workshops at universities across India and have delivered talk in Cisco SecCon packet village, 2019.
      
      I actively work on threat hunting, reverse engineering various malware samples and build honeypots to catch threats in the wild. 
      My arsenal includes malware reversing and analysis skills, Metasploit skills, and I also have a strong interest towards memory forensics.

      I have also published blogs related to interesting findings that I have come across in this domain:

In an era of Spams and Hams, we need to keep an eye out for document attachments in emails.
Malwares today heavily operate using e-mail attachments as a means to enter a victim’s system.
It’s a stroll in the park to spot plain malicious code in a document but what if it is obfuscated .
Well, the level of obfuscation equals the time spent to decode that portion in a document.
Obfuscation holds the key in today’s threat landscape and also level of obfuscation matters too.
In this talk we will take a look at some of the peek-a-boos that malware authors play with us and also some end game level obfuscation techniques.
